## Instructions I Followed

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, I opened `js/app.js` and started building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
